## Contributing

We're totally open to contributors! If you need help getting started,
feel free to message Nicholas Yang.

To set up the back end, simply install Ruby version 2.6.3 (we
encourage using rbenv or rvm!) and run `bundle install`. If that
works, you can run the server with `bin/rails server`

To set up the front end, cd into `client` and run `npm install`. From
there, `npm start` should run the client. 

To do any real development, you need to run the server and the
client. Please do not assume your code works without running both at
the same time.

We use prettier with the default config. We encourage setting up
autoformatting on save.
